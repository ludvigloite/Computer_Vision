# TDT4265 - Computer Vision and Deep Learning

Final Project was about detecting wear and tear on roads, where we trained an object detector to perform road
damage detection.

We were given two different datasets. One was a public road damage detection dataset [[Maeda et al., 2018]](#References) that covered roads from all around the world. Another dataset was videos recorded of Norwegian roads. These videoes were to be annotated by the student of this course.

Our final solution is presented in *Final_Presentation.pdf*.
